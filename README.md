> The Google Apps Script environment has it’s own internal version control system which is all managed through the Apps Script editor. It doesn’t play nice with external repositories — e.g. it doesn’t support folder structures and has limits in how you can commit code, etc. The `origin` for the project is currently scoped within the Apps Script project itself — this repo is simply a duplicate of the latest version to expose it publicly.
